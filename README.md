In this project, my colleagues and I analyzed yearly employment data via US Census Bureau data sets to answer the following questions: 

(1) what types of businesses (i.e. sectors) produced the most jobs in the US? 

(2) Which locations have the most competition for startups? and 

(3) during which periods of time had the most changes in employment? 

Using time series models, data scraping, visualization techniques using the ggplot2 package, and other statistical methods, we have constructed a brief retrospective report of how employment rates for various job sectors have contributed to the US economy. Data wrangling was done using RStudio but various regression analysis tools were employed from previous statistics courses. 

My main role was to help develop the research plan, methodology, and strategize feasible and productive ways to ask the right questions, tease data, and abstract valid analysis for the project.
